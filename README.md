# AutoShowChoice

A basic program that will ask you if you want to watch an Action or Adventure anime show. Depending on what genre you choose, it will give you the option to print the list of 5 animes in that respective genre or if you can't choose, you can have the program choose for you.

The code in this program is very drawn out on purpose. The goal was to practice various topics of Python such as creating and referencing lists, using input function, defining functions, else/if statements as well as nested else/if's.
